Parameter,Description
μ_in,"The mean of the performance metric when the process is in-control, i.e., when there is no performance drift​"
ARL_0,Number of observations before the control chart signals a false detection​
σ_in,The in-control standard deviation of the metric​
ARL_1,Number of observations before the control chart signals a true detection​
k,"The normalized reference value, which is related to the magnitude of change that one is interested in detecting. k = 0.5 is the default choice for detecting a unit standard deviation change​"
S_hi,Cumulative sum of positive changes in the metric​
h,The normalized threshold or control limit (default =4). This threshold determines when the control chart signals a detection​
S_lo,Cumulative sum of negative changes in the metric​
